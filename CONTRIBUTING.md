# Contributing to Angular Primitives

Thank you for checking out the project and wanting to contribute!

## Contribution Process

Waiting community decision [RFC - Primitives Names definition](https://github.com/angular-primitives/angular-primitives/issues/5)

## Guideline

Our objective with Angular Primitives is to provide solutions to facilitate the day-to-day of the developer, for this to happen, the collaboration of the whole community is essential. In addition, we need to maintain a level of quality in our implementations, so it is recommended:

1. Each primitive must have only one purpose
2. Test the main use cases
3. Avoid using third-party libraries
4. Document as much as possible
5. No dependence or as little as possible
6. Special attention to performance
7. Involve the community in decision-making
8. Strong typing in API development

PS: This repository is intended to compose the angular ecosystem, it makes no sense to develop something that is made available by the angular core

## Tooling

### Formatting and Linting

We use [**eslint**](https://eslint.org/) and [**prettier**](https://prettier.io/) to lint and format the code. You can run `npm lint` to check for linting errors and `npm format` to format the code.

Having them installed and enabled in your editor is not required but should help you in the development process.

### Operating System

This repository should work on any operating system.

### Root CLI Helpers

Available node scripts for managing libraries and creating new ones:

- `ng generate library name-of-your-library` - Create a new library angular.
- `ng build name-of-your-library` - Builds all the packages.
- `npm run start` - Start demos.
- `npm run build` - Build demos
- `npm run test` - Tests demos.
- `npm run lint` - Lints demos.
